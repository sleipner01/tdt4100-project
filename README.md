# Airline Manager

This is a project I made in the course [TDT4100 Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4100#tab=omEmnet). It is a game where you can create your own airline, buy planes, board passangers and fly around the world. The airports are manually added and stored in a csv file with coordinates. The distance between the airports are calculated using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).


## About the project
The project description is written in ["prosjektbeskrivelse"](prosjektbeskrivelse_2022.pdf) but is written in Norwegian. In short, the goal was to make an application with Java, that had at least 4 classes, 1 interface, used JavaFX, and could be tested. We needed to both write and read for at least one file.

### Other comments

In hindsight I have realized that the resources folder cannot be written to when packaged as jar...
